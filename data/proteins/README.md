# mass spectrometry of proteins data for space project

When the researchers performed the mass spectroscopy, they pooled together multiple samples so that they wouldn't have to perform the mass spectrometry one time for each sample (it's a quite expensive and tedious process). 

Group A contained the vivarium and basal samples which are not relevant for us. 

Group B consisted of ground control (GC) samples 21, 22, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, a pool of all NASA GC samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) GC samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. 

Group C consisted of spaceflight (FLT) samples 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, a pool of all NASA FLT samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) FLT samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples.
